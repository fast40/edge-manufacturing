CAD management for edge manufacturing is important.


People who experience broken parts often don't have a clue about CAD/manufacturing etc.
- our solution should be very easy to use for this reason.


Broken part -> OUR SOLUTION -> new manufactured replacement

our solution needs to both manage CAD and manage manufacturing execution.

- manage CAD
	- eli + ryan
	- as quickly as possible get from broken part to part ID
- manufacturing execution
	- sean
	- as quickly as possible from CAD to part


- for specific part group and manufacturing technique.
	- 3d printing
	- work on parts which are easily distunguishable and good candidates for 3d printing
	- parts which break often


if the part is broken, how to id it?

part id not written on part
computer vision to go from part to ID (this is hard for similar parts. May want to incorporate other part attributes into search, e.g. vehicle name etc.)

smart way of catalogging parts

- engine part from X vehicle etc.

Website where
- it's super easy for manufacturers to dump all field-manufacturable CAD files
- it's super easy for people to search for the machine where the part came from and locate CAD of broken part
